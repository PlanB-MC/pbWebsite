        "desc": "...And so may great Minecraft servers, it seems. A couple of years ago, Lovecraft, a vanilla Minecraft community, disappeared into the void together with its owner. We, a dedicated group of players and friends that played on it, have no clue where it went, but it left us without a home. We decided to not let that setback get to us and to continue its legacy in the form of a new server, where we could continue to express our creativity and unleash our wildest ideas. We decided it was time for a PlanB Now 3 maps later we are standing at the gateway of the aquatic update and are looking for new players (Aged 18+) to join us in our exploration of these unknown waters on a brand new map for season 5! We will be resetting on the full spigot release of update aquatic. Until then you can enjoy our 1.12.2 world."

The headshop won’t be unlocked until the server as a collective has obtained every item in game and once the server has slain a whopping 1000 shulkers it will be awarded with a shulker spawner in the end dimension. And more challenges await this season with exciting rewards!"
