        "desc": "...And so may great Minecraft servers, it seems. A couple of years ago, Lovecraft, a vanilla Minecraft community, disappeared into the void together with its owner. We, a dedicated group of players and friends that played on it, have no clue where it went, but it left us without a home. We decided to not let that setback get to us and to continue its legacy in the form of a new server, where we could continue to express our creativity and unleash our wildest ideas. We decided it was time for a PlanB Now 3 maps later we are standing at the gateway of the aquatic update and are looking for new players (Aged 18+) to join us in our exploration of these unknown waters on a brand new map for season 5! We will be resetting on the full spigot release of update aquatic. Until then you can enjoy our 1.12.2 world."
